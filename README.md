# Scan-Credo
Scan Credo is a mobile app for Android devices that assists individuals in recharging their airtime by conveniently scanning their airtime cards using the built-in camera of their smartphones. This approach saves time and eliminates the inconvenience of manually inputting airtime card numbers one at a time. To accomplish its purpose, the application incorporates various technologies, including firebase authentication, firebase ML kit, permissions, and explicit call intent. It is important for the user to have an internet connection while using the app.Below are screenshots on how the app works.
